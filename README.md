#IOT 
This is the repository for our previous codes in which we did the GET POST seperately. We changed the schema code and added some more attributes to it. 

1. Main_Server_POST:- It is the file to run the server in POST mode.
2. Main_Server_GET:- It is the file to run the server in GET mode.
3. mongo:- It is the file where we defined the database schema.
