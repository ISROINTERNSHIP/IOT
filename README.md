#IOT 
This is the repository for our previous codes in which we did the GET POST seperately. We changed the schema code and added some more attributes to it. 

Please see the code and screenshots,now I created analog and digital schema differently also we can able to send didgital and analog sensor code from one python code so if person is using two sensors they can send the data.

1. Server.js :- this the server file 
2. api.js :- this the file that routes the data to particular schema.
3. analog/digita.js :- these are the files that presnet in the model folder and contains the analog and digital schema.
