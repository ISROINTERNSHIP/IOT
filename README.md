#IOT 
This is the repository for our previous codes in which we did the GET POST seperately. We changed the schema code and added some more attributes to it. 

1. Main_Server_POST:- It is the file to run the server in POST mode.
2. Main_Server_GET:- It is the file to run the server in GET mode.
3. mongo:- It is the file where we defined the database schema.

Please see the code and screenshots,now I created analog and digital schema differently also we can able to send didgital and analog sensor code from one python code so if person is using two sensors they can send the data.
